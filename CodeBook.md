# Code Book for tidy data set
Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

### Introduction 

This is the code book for the **tidydataset.txt** file that was generated by the **run_analysis.R** script. For the deail of the script, please refer to **README.md** file. 

This file contains 68 varialbes add 180 observations. The first 2 variables, Subject and Activity represent people and activities respectively and the rest of the variables represents the summary, either mean or standard deviation, of the features of the mean or deviation that were originally measured from the accelerometers from Samsung Galaxy S smartphone on the wrist for all combinations of Subjects and Activities.  

The measurements were collected from 30 people and 6 activiies, therefore 30 x 6 = 180 observations. The original data set contains 7352 training data and 2947 test data for 561 measurements, which was obtained from the following URL:

### Variables/Columns 

**Subject**

This is the numbers from 1 to 30 that represents poeple who particiated the measurements.

**Activity** 

This represents the activiteis measured for each people. The following 6 activites are measured: 

1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5. STANDING
6. LAYING

**Summary of Features Measured**  

The followig shows a list of 66 variables measured. The **mean** in the variable name, e.g., tBodyAcc.mean...X, indicates the mean() of the measurements and the **std** in the variable name indicates the std() or standard deviaiton of the measurements. 

* Body: Data/signal obtained from body
* Acc: Data from accelerometer, unit is standard gravity units 'g'
* Gravity: Data/signal obtained from grabity, 
* Jerk: Derived data obtained from body linear accelerationand angular velocity 
* Gyro: Data from gyroscope, unit is radians/second
* Mag: Magniure calcuated using the Euclidean norm
* X: X axis direction movement
* Y: Y axis direction movement
* Z: Z axis direciton movement
